- 

- You will write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats. Your computer will find it a bit more difficult.

>Don't forget to always be resourceful!

## üå±  How to start this project

You will not be forking this time, please take some time to read this instructions:

1. Create a new repository based on [machine learning project](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template/generate) by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template).
2. Open the recently created repostiroy on Gitpod by using the [Gitpod button extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/).
3. Once Gitpod VSCode has finished opening you start your project following the Instructions below.

## üöõ How to deliver this project

Once you are finished creating your image classifier, make sure to commit your changes, push to your repository and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.


## üìù Instructions

**Image Classifier**

The dataset is comprised of photos of dogs and cats provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset of 3 million manually annotated photos. The dataset was developed as a partnership between Petfinder.com and Microsoft.

The dataset was originally used as a CAPTCHA, that is, a task that it is believed a human finds trivial, but cannot be solved by a machine, used on websites to distinguish between human users and bots. The task was referred to as "Asirra". When "Asirra" was presented, it was mentioned 'that user studies indicate it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Barring a major advance in machine vision, we expect computers will have no better than a 1/54,000 chance of solving it'.

At the time that the competition was posted, the state-of-the-art result was achieved with an SVM and described in a 2007 paper with the title ‚ÄúMachine Learning Attacks Against the Asirra CAPTCHA‚Äù (PDF) that achieved 80% classification accuracy. It was this paper that demonstrated that the task was no longer a suitable task for a CAPTCHA soon after the task was proposed.

The dataset is straightforward to understand and small enough to fit into memory and get started with computer vision and convolutional neural networks.
